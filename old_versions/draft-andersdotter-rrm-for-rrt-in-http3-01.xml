    <abstract>

      <t>The latency spin bit is an optional feature included in the <xref target="I-D-QUIC">QUIC transport protocol</xref>. It enables passive, on-path observations for estimation of latency. This document presents the results of an inquiry into the possibility of using randomized response mechanisms (RRM) to reduce privacy loss in latency measurements. It concludes that RRM could be used to introduce choice for clients in preserving privacy in latency measurements. But the trade-offs, especially since the latency spin bit is already optional, do not favour RRM.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

      <t>At the IETF104 convening of the Privacy Enhancements and Assessments Research Group (PEARG), a presentation on Differential Privacy (<xref target="AA-CL"/>) gave rise to the idea of trying to apply randomized response methods to the QUIC spin bit described in <xref target="TRAMMEL"/> and <xref target="KUEHLEWIND"/>. The spin bit, now incorporated in <xref target="I-D-QUIC">Section 17.3.1</xref>, has generated controversy from a privacy perspective, both in the Working Group meetings and on the QUIC email list. Controversies were re-ignited through the publication of a Human Rights Consideration in <xref target="TENOEVER-MARTINI"/>. 
      //TODO: fix
      Applying RRM is an attempt to address two problems: the privacy loss incurred through the spin bit, and considering the potential of using RRM to have more than one bit assisting in latency measurement as per previous proposals.

  <section anchor="rrt" title="Randomized Response Mechanisms">

    <t>Randomized response trials were originally created for binary environments: if a series of measurements have only two possible outcomes (0 or 1, yes or no, true or false, for example), allowing individual respondents to answer "falsely" at a predictable rate will still preserve the ability to make inferences on the entire set of respondents. The latency spin bit, being a bit, is a binary outcome variable. Each time it is measured, the idea is that it can either "truthfully" report its value as what it should be according to <xref target="TRAMMEL"/>, or it could, at some known rate or probability, report the opposite value.</t>

    <t>RRMs are easily illustrated for binary response problems. Let's take as an example "Did you go to the last IETF meeting?" The answer to this question is either yes or no. Let us suppose that 25% of all responses are known to be false, and that 80% of all respondents answered yes. Then 60% of the respondents who answered yes can be assumed to have done so truthfully, while 5% of the respondents who answered no have done so falsely. 65% of the respondents can therefore be estimated to have actually attended the last IETF meeting.</t>

    <t>RRMs can also be applied to multiple choice questions. Estimation of true proportions becomes more difficult as the number of possible answers per question goes up. Further examples, including formulas and calculations, can be found in <xref target="DWORK"/> and <xref target="FOX"/>.</t>

  <section anchor="asb" title="Application to latency spin bit">

    <t>As described in <xref target="TRAMMEL"/>, the latency spin bit is a mechanism for measuring round-trip-times (RTT) in the QUIC protocol. The investigation in this document relies on <xref target="TRAMMEL"/> for its understanding of the basic operation of the latency spin bit, and in particular the following paragraphs and figures from the document are quoted to facilitate the description of RRM below:</t>

    <t>[Begin quote] Initially, during connection establishment, no packets with a spin bit are in flight, as shown in <xref target="illus0"/>.</t>

    <t>Either the server, the client, or both can begin sending packets with short
      headers after connection establishment, as shown in <xref target="illus1"/>; here, no spin
      edges are yet in transit.

    <t>Once the serverâ€™s first 0-marked packet arrives at the client, the client sets
      its spin value to 1, and begins sending packets with the spin bit set, as

    <t> In each iteration going from <xref target="illus3" /> to <xref target="illus4" /> a sequence of 0s or 1s the length of which is k0 for iteration 0, k1 for iteration 1, and so forth, can be observed (by on-path observers X or Y in <xref target="illus4" />). The length of each sequence equals the amount of ticks required to pass from the client back to the client. After observation n lengths of such sequences, (k[0], ..., k[n]), an average can be taken over k[j]. This average can be multiplied by the amount of time per tick (a quantity which is assumed to be known) to get a value for the round-trip time (RTT).</t>

    <t>Applying randomized response mechanisms (RRMs) perturbs the observed sequence lengths (k[0], ..., k[n]). The perturbation will have the effect of lengthening, shortening, or making more arbitrary the lengths of the sequences, thereby increasing the variance, or disable the possibility, of an estimator of the true RTT value.</t>

    <t>The server or the client is assumed to behave as described in <xref target="illus3" /> and <xref target="illus4" />, unless specifically stated otherwise. That means the assumed default behaviour is that a "truly" reflecting server that receives a bit set to v=0 always reflects a bit with v=0. In an RRM application, a server which "falsely" reflects a bit receives a bit set to v=0 and reflects a bit set to v=1. Similarly, the assumed default behaviour of a client is that it "truly" inverts a bit, so that receiving a bit set to v=0 causes it to transmit a bit set to v=1. In an RRM application, the client may "falsely" transmit a bit set to v=0 even when it has received a bit set to v=0. The receiving of a spin edge is assumed to be a trigger event for a reflection or an inversion. The server and the client are assumed to have an internal spin value that determines the spin bit that goes out. Every time a spin edge comes in (a trigger), this internal spin value is changed, changing also the outgoing spin value.</t>

    <t>An additional assumption is that the server and client behave independently of one another. This means that the server has no information on whether the client has omitted an inversion, and the client has no information on whether the server has omitted a reflection. Omissions are therefore independent events.</t>

    <t>We have looked at two ways of perturbing measurements:</t>

    <t><list style="numbers">
      <t>RRMs are applied so that that each bit transmitted, whether or not an inversion is occurring, has a probability P of being the "wrong" value ("Each bit RRM").</t>
      <t>RRMs are applied so that edge transitions do not occur with probability P or Q for server and client respectively("Edge transition RRM").</t>
    </list></t>

    <t>They will be dealt with in turn, identifying pitfalls and potential ways of addressing those pitfalls. The goal is to have better privacy-protecting properties while continuing to allow utility of the on-path observations in latency measurements.</t>


    <section anchor="eachbit" title="RRM at each bit">

      <t>Let us say any bit transmitted from either the client or the server is "off" in relation to what it proposed in the Spin Bit model with some probability Q. If Q = 0.5, the spinning bits will come across as a random 0s and 1s and it will be difficult to estimate any edge. However, if Q is less than 0.5, the spin edge can be estimated for instance by computing an average number of 0s or 1s in the past m ticks. For all averages above some cut-off rate, a measurement counter could be incremented by one. Eventually one would end up with a series (k'0, ..., k'n) that roughly corresponds to (k0, ..., kn) above.</t>

      <section anchor="example4" title="Client perturbation">

        <t>The bit spins in the foreseen way. Every time a bit is transmitted, there is a probability Q that it holds a different value than it should. In <xref target="illus4" /> , either measurements station X or both stations Y observe a passing bit, as well as bits passing before or after that bit (if any). After observing 2k+1 bits (b[-k], ..., b[0], ..., b[k]) the true value of bit b[0] is estimated, for instance based on whether the majority of b[i] were v=0 or v=1. The estimated value is then used to increment a sequence counter.</t>

        <t>The estimator follows a binomial distribution (drawing with replacement), and the risk of misidentifying a bit is equal to the risk of having (k+1) v=1 bits in the 2k observations where b[0] "should" be attributed to v=0. This risk depends on Q and k.</t>

        <t>Setting k too large creates a risk of having estimator sequences that are longer than the round-trip time (RTT) to be measured. If Q is reasonably small, estimation will still eventually be possible after a sufficient amount of measurements. One option is to keep Q variable and determined by the client, introducing the possibility of choice in RTT measurements.</t>

        <t>Make the following assumptions:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>The "real" round-trip time is 6+7=13, where 6 is the number of ticks between the client and server, and 7 is the number of ticks between server and client.</t>
          <t>The server always reflects exactly the value of the bit it receives, and</t>
          <t>The client always inverts the value of the bit it receives, meaning that all spin edges are always preserved.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>Four RTTs of the spin bit according to specification would now give rise to the following data, available to an on-path observer: 0000000000000111111111111100000000000001111111111111. To estimate the time of a RTT, we could compute 13*4/4 = 13 time units.</t>

        <t>Set Q=0.2. Now the four RTTs may instead be measured as 1001000000100111111001111100000010010110111011010111. With this sequence, we would instead estimate (1+2+1+6+1+2+6+2+5+6+1+2+ 1+1+2+1+3+1+2+1+1+1+3)/23 = 2.26. That is clearly not satisfactory if the target round-trip time estimation is 13.</t>

        <t>Divide the RTT measurements into moving windows with k=2 (i.e., each window contains (b[-2], b[-1], b[0], b[1], b[2])) to arrive at [(10010), (00100), (01000), (10000), (00000), (00000), (00001), (00010), (00100), etc]. Each window estimates b[0], so the "true" value of bit 2 will be estimated by (10010), the true value of bit three from (00100), and so forth.</t>

        <t>Applying the procedure we are left with 000000000011111111111111000000000011111111111111, or (10+14+14+10)/4=12. This is much better precision if the target round-trip time estimation is 13.</t> 

      </section>

      <section anchor="example5" title="Client and server perturbation">

        <t>Now let us consider the case where both the client and server randomize each transmitted bit, with probabilities Q and P respectively. Using the same assumptions as in <xref target="example4" /> and the same target RTT of 13, and letting Q=0.2 and P=0.1, we may end up measuring 0000000000000111111111011100000001010001111010011111 and throw the method of moving windows for k=2 arriving at 000000000001111111111111000000000000011111001111 leaving us with sequences of length (11, 13, 13, 5, 2, 4).</t>

        <t>As previously mentioned, the risk of a bit being misidentified is related to P, Q and k. Because a misidentified bit always make sequences appear to be of shorter length, the sequences that measure greater length should be taken as the RTT estimate. In this event that we choose to only use that half of the esimated sequences with the greatest length as a basis for the latency calculations, we would have (11+13+13)/3=12.3 as the estimator for the RTT.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="discussion2" title="Discussion">

        <t>In the introduction to this section, we observed that setting Q=0.5 would make any pattern recognition among the bits extremely difficult for the most advanced of filters. We proceeded to discuss the case Q=0.2 and a potential filter for this case in <xref target="example4" />. If Q is taken to be a parameter under client control, of course the client could set Q so that latency measurements are made impossible. On the other hand, such client control already exists, since the latency spin bit is optional. (see <xref target="RFC6973">Sec. 7.2</xref> and <xref target="I-D-QUIC">Section 17.3.1</xref>). </t>

        <t>In <xref target="example5"/> we introduced the possiblity of yet another parameter P, to be set by the server for determining server-side RRM application. The moving windows filtering method applied to make sense of on-path observations remains the same.</t>

        <t>The filtering methods applied in this section consistently under-estimate the true latency. More accurate latency measurements may be achieved by having a larger number of sequences observed.</t>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section anchor="reflection" title="RRM at edge transition">

      <t>The omission of a reflection or inversion creates difficulties. Namely, let's say the client omits the inversion in <xref target="illus4" />. Now there is no longer a spin edge so there is nothing to activate future reflections/inversions.</t>

      <section anchor="assumptions" title="Assumptions on the spin bit mechanism">

        <t>Deciding on a RRM scheme for RTT in QUIC requires a more explicitly defined mechanism for changing the spin value (the value of the spin bit being transmitted from the client or server) than presently is the case in <xref target="TRAMMEL"/>. For instance, the way in which the server is specified to change its spin value currently is:</t>

        <t>
          "The server initializes its spin value to 0.  When it receives a
          packet from the client, if that packet has a short header and if
          it increments the highest packet number seen by the server from
          the client, it sets the spin value to the spin bit in the received
          packet."
        </t>

        <t>while the mechanism for changing the spin value in the client is</t>

        <t>
          "The client initializes its spin value to 0.  When it receives a
          packet from the server, if the packet has a short header and if it
          increments the highest packet number seen by the client from the
          server, it sets the spin value to the opposite of the spin bit in
          the received packet."

        </t>

        <t>
          The goal of the designer in <xref target="TRAMMEL"/> is to cause the spin bit to change its value once per round-trip. Our design goal is different. We want to have the spin bit only sometimes change its value once per round-trip, while it might other times change its value twice per round-trip, or not at all. Additionally, we have the goal of ensuring that we can exercise control over what percentage of round-trips give useful measurements. To simultaneously fill all of those requirements, we introduce the following additional constraints on updating the spin value:
        </t>

        <t>
          <list style="numbers">

            <t>Client and server have an <spanx>internal spin value</spanx> (NV) which decides the value of the next outgoing spin bit.</t>
            <t>Clients and server keep track of the second-to-last incoming spin bit (SLISB), and the last incoming spin bit (LISB).</t>
            <t> The NV initializes to 0 at both the client and the server.</t>
            <t> An <spanx>inversion</spanx> of the client's NV is triggered if SLISB and LISB have different values. Notably, no comparison between the SLISB or LISB and the NV is made. The value of the NV, which determines the value of the next spin bit transmitted, is set independently of the value of the SLISB and LISB.</t>
            <t> An inversion does not happen with probability <spanx>q</spanx>, even when it should.</t>
            <t> A <spanx>reflection</spanx> of the server's NV is also triggered if SLISB and LISB have different values.</t>
            <t> A reflection does not happen with probability <spanx>p</spanx>, even when it should.</t>
            <t> In the absence of a triggering event, the NV does not change its value and the client or server continue to transmit bits holding the current NV value.</t>
            <t> Client and server <spanx>act independently</spanx> of one another, so that neither client or server have any way of determining whether the other has reflected or inverted ``truthfully''.</t>
            <t> A special case is the first time a spin bit is recorded by a client or server (immediately after initialization). In this case, the client and server both update the NV truthfully.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>We illustrate these assumptions with a truth table for the client in <xref target="truth_table_client"/> and for the server in <xref target="truth_table_server" />.</t>

      <section anchor="explained" title="One and a half round-trip explained">
        <t>
          Recall the assumptions in <xref target="assumptions"/>. Suppose that a round trip takes <spanx>2n</spanx> time units. If we initialize spin bits at the client and server to 0 (assumption 3), they will both see (SLISB, LISB)= (âˆ’,0) after n time units, and an NV change is triggered (assumption 10). Now the client maintains an NV value of 1 while the server sets its NV value to 0.
        </t>

        <t>
          The client now transmits spin bits valued <spanx>1</spanx> to the server, while the server continues to transmit spin bits valued <spanx>0</spanx> to the client. After another <spanx>n</spanx> time units (<spanx>2n</spanx> time units in total) the client sees a (SLISB, LISB)-tuple valued <spanx>(0,0)</spanx>, while the server will see a (SLISB, LISB)-tuple <spanx>(1,0)</spanx> (assumption 2). This triggers an attempted reflection by the server, meaning that its NV should be changed from <spanx>0</spanx> to <spanx>1</spanx> (assumption 6), while a change in the client NV (<spanx>1</spanx>) is not triggered (assumption 4). Suppose that the server truthfully reflects its NV to <spanx>1</spanx>. Now the client continues to transmit <spanx>1</spanx>s to the server, while the server transmits <spanx>1</spanx>s to the client. 
        </t>

        <t>
          After yet another <spanx>n</spanx> time units (<spanx>3n</spanx> time units in total) the server will see the (SLISB, LISB)-tuple <spanx>(1,1)</spanx> and therefore do nothing (assumption 8), while the client sees the tuple <spanx>(0,1)</spanx> and tries to update its NV (assumption 4). If the client does not do this, so that the client NV remains at <spanx>1</spanx>, then the client will be transmitting <spanx>1</spanx>s to the server and the server will be transmitting <spanx>1</spanx>s to the client. 

        </t>

        <t>
          After <spanx>4n</spanx> time units, the (SLISB, LISB)-tuples seen by both the client and the server will be <spanx>(1,1)</spanx>, and both NVs will also be set to <spanx>1</spanx>. Consequently, the (lack of) NV updates after <spanx>3n</spanx> time units have landed us in the situation that there is no longer any possibility for a (SLISB, LISB)-tuple to have different values, and we have ended up in a loop.

        </t>

        <t>

          This is encouraging, since a loop can be escaped by randomly re-initializing the spin bit after some time that we can choose.

  <section anchor="conclusion" title="Conclusion">

    <t>
It is possible to apply to RRM to QUIC RTT measurements in a way which delays estimation of RTT. However, it is unclear whether RRM has advantages larger than already existing privacy mechanisms included in the QUIC draft (such as making the spin bit optional, or requiring that 1/8 of all streams are not measurable). The privacy concern associated with a spin bit is that latency measurements will enable inference of the location or distance of the device associated with that particular IP address. But the whole point of differential privacy mechanisms, including RRM, is using statistical methods to ensure that data can be made more privacy-preserving while also preserving the data utility. In the case of the spin bit, it is the utility of the data that allegedly violates privacy, which means differential privacy is an intuitively bad tool to address privacy concerns.
</t>

<t>

The spin bit is associated with an IP address, which creates linkability. Any differential privacy mechanism will not remove linkability from the spin bit, and so preserves that angle of privacy violation.

</t>

<t>
RRM could potentially be used to fulfill requirements from the QUIC draft 27, sec. 17.3.1, in a slightly more flexible way than is currently discussed at the IETF. In particular, the parameters <spanx>p</spanx>, <spanx>q</spanx> and <spanx>r</spanx> discussed in section //TODO:parameters could be adjusted to accommodate for any proportion of useful measurements. If <spanx>r</spanx> is left for the client to decide, the client may even have influence over the extent to which RTT measurements through the QUIC spin bit is made more difficult.
</t>

<t>
In order to realize such advantages the functioning of the QUIC spin bit does, however, need to be more stringently specified, in particular in line with our suggestions in section <xref target="assumptions"/>.
