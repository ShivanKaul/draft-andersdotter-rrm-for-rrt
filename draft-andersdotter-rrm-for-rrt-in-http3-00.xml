    <abstract>

<t>The Latency Spin Bit is an optional feature included in <xref target="I-D-QUIC">I-D-QUIC, sec. 17.3.1</xref>. It enables passive latency monitoring from observation points on the network path throughout the duration of a connection. This draft presents the results of an inquiry into the potential of using randomized response mechanism (RRM) to enhance privacy gain in latency measurements. It concludes that RRM could be used to introduce choice for web browser clients in preserving privacy in latency measurements, but only at the cost of losing the utility of the latency measurements.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>At the IETF104 convening of the Privacy Enhancements and (PEA) Research Group, a presentation on Differential Privacy (<xref target="AA-CL"/>) gave rise to the idea of trying to apply Randomized Response methods to the QUIC Spin Bit described in <xref target="TRAMMEL"/> and <xref target="KUEHLEWIND"/>. The QUIC Spin Bit had generated controversy from a privacy perspective, both in the Working Group meetings and on e-mailing lists and been re-ignited through the publication of a subsequent Human Rights Consideration in <xref target="TENOEVER-MARTINI"/>. 
</t>

<t>Randomized response trials were originally created for binary environments: if a series of measurements has only two possible outcomes (0 or 1, yes or no, true or false, for instance), it is the idea that allowing individual respondents to answer "falsely" at a predictable rate will still preserve the ability to make inferences on the entire set of respondents. The Spin Bit, being a bit, is binary outcome variable. Each time it is measured, the idea is that it can either "truthfully" report its value as what it should be according to <xref target="TRAMMEL"/>, or it could, at some known rate or probability, report the opposite value.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="rrt" title="Randomized Response Mechanisms">

  <t>Randomized Response Mechanisms (RRM) rely on the ability to make sense of data with known errors and were originally developed to facilitate surveys on sensitive topics such as alcohol or drug abuse, or political affiliation. The design allows a survey taker to provide, with some known probability P, a "false" answer ("yes" instead of "no", for example) to a survey question. It is meant to encourage truthful answers even in surveys where participants may otherwise feel compelled to give false answers.</t>

  <t>RRMs are most easily illustrated for binary response problems. Let's take as an example "Did you go to the last IETF meeting?" The answer to this question is either yes or no. If 30% of all responses are known to be false, we have four categories of responses: true yes, true no, false yes and false no. From these numbers we can estimate the proportion of recurring visitors to the IETF.</t>

  <t>RRMs can also be applied to multiple choice questions. Estimation of true proportions becomes more difficult as the number of possible answers per question goes up. Further examples, including formulas and calculations, can be found in <xref target="DWORK"/> and <xref target="FOX"/>.</t>
  
</section>

<section anchor="asb" title="Application to Spin Bit">

<t>As described in <xref target="TRAMMEL"/>, the Spin Bit is a mechanism for measuring round-trip-times (RTT) in the QUIC protocol. Its operation is captured by the following five images, extracted from this draft:</t>

<t>Initially, during connection establishment, no packets with a spin bit are in flight, as shown in <xref target="illus0"/>.</t>

<figure title="Initial state, no spin bit between client and server" anchor="illus0"><artwork><![CDATA[
+--------+   -  -  -  -  -   +--------+
|        |     -------->     |        |

|        |     <--------     |        |
+--------+   -  -  -  -  -   +--------+
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Either the server, the client, or both can begin sending packets with short
headers after connection establishment, as shown in <xref target="illus1"/>; here, no spin
edges are yet in transit.</t>

<figure title="Client and server begin sending packets with spin 0" anchor="illus1"><artwork><![CDATA[
+--------+   0  0  -  -  -   +--------+
|        |     -------->     |        |

|        |     <--------     |        |
+--------+   -  -  0  0  0   +--------+
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Once the serverâ€™s first 0-marked packet arrives at the client, the client sets
its spin value to 1, and begins sending packets with the spin bit set, as
shown in <xref target="illus2"/>. The spin edge is now in transit toward the server.</t>

<figure title="The bit begins spinning" anchor="illus2"><artwork><![CDATA[

|        |     <--------     |        |
+--------+   0  0  0  0  0   +--------+
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Five ticks later, this packet arrives at the server, which takes its spin
value from it and reflects that value back on the next packet it sends, as
shown in <xref target="illus3"/>. The spin edge is now in transit toward the client.</t>

<figure title="Server reflects the spin edge" anchor="illus3"><artwork><![CDATA[

+--------+   0  0  0  0  1   +--------+
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Five ticks later, the 1-marked packet arrives at the client, which inverts its
spin value and sends the inverted value on the next packet it sends, as shown
in <xref target="illus4"/>.</t>

<figure title="Client inverts the spin edge" anchor="illus4"><artwork><![CDATA[

<t> In each iteration of <xref target="illus3" />-<xref target="illus4" /> the a sequence of 0s or 1s the length of which is k0 for iteration 0, k1 for iteration 1, and so forth, can be measured (by X or Y in the picture). The length of each sequence equals the amount of ticks required to pass from the client back to the client. After n iterations, an average can be taken of the measurements (k0, ..., kn). This average can be multiplied by the amount of time per tick (a quantity which is assumed to be known) to get a value for the round-trip time (RTT).</t>

<t>Applying randomized response mechanisms (RRMs) perturbs the measurements (k0, ..., kn). The perturbation will have the effect of lengthening, shortening, or making more arbitrary the size of the measurement, thereby increasing the variance, or disable the possibility, of an estimator of the true RTT value.</t>

<t>The server or the client is assumed to always behave as described in <xref target="illus3" />-<xref target="illus4" /> with no RRM. That means the assumed default behaviour is that a "truly" reflecting server that receives a bit set to v=0 always reflects a bit with v=0, while a server which "falsely" reflects a bit receives a bit set to v=0 and reflects a bit set to v=1. Different probabilities could be applied to the server and client, respectively, transmitting a "wrong" value or delaying a reflection.</t>

<t>An additional assumption is that the server and client behave independently of one another. This means that the server has no information on whether the client has omitted an inversion, and the client has no information on whether the server has omitted a reflection. Omissions are therefore independent events.</t>

<t>We have looked at three ways of perturbing measurements:</t>

<t><list>
  <t>1. RRMs are applied so that the reflections in <xref target="illus3" /> or inversions in <xref target="illus4" /> do not occur with probability P or Q respectively.</t>
  <t>2. RRMs are applied so that that each bit transmitted from the client, whether or not an inversion is occurring, has a probability P of being the "wrong" value.</t>
  <t>3. RRMs are applied so that that each bit transmitted from the server, whether or not a reflection is occurring, has a probability Q of being the "wrong" value.</t>
</list>
</t>

<section anchor="reflection" title="Case 1: RRM at reflection/inversion">

  <t>The omission of a reflection or inversion creates difficulties. Namely, let's say the client omits the inversion in <xref target="illus4" />. Now there is no longer a spin edge so there is nothing to activate future reflections/inversions.</t>

  <t>A possible work-around is to do random re-sets of the spin bit, i.e., starting the process fresh from <xref target="illus1" />. Observers X and Y in <xref target="illus4" /> would then get a series of measurements (k0, ..., kn), some of which were far too large, but would, over time, be able to deduce RTT from the smaller measurements. The expected proportion of large and small measurements in the whole set of measurements could be determined from the probabilities that a reflection/inversion does not happen and the probability that the spin bit is re-initiated.</t>

  <t>Another possible work-around is having an additional bit to indicate a spin edge, assigned by the server to the bit which is (not) reflected in <xref target="illus3" />, or by the client to the bit which is (not) inverted in <xref target="illus4" />. In this case there would not be a point in applying RRM since the placement of the spin edge would no longer be obfuscated.</t>

  <t>If the ordinary spin edge is obfuscated by through omission of reflection/inversion, and the edge-identifying bit is also, with some probability, not correctly identifying an edge, the utility of having two latency bits again goes up at no additional loss of privacy.</t>
  
<section anchor="example1" title="Analysis: No reset and no edge identifying bit">
    
<t>The bit starts spinning with value v=1 in <xref target="illus2" />. At the point of reflection (see <xref target="illus3" />), it does not reflect with probability P. At the point of inversion (see <xref target="illus4" />), it does not invert with probability Q. We consider P and Q respectively to be the probability that the server or client does not behave in the way specified.</t> 

	<t>Let -> be the operation that a bit changes value. A correct reflection will be denoted R: a->a. A correct inversion is denoted I:a->b. Prefixing R or I with a ! denotes that reflection/inversion was not done correctly. The variables a and b assume the values 0 or 1 and are never equal. P(R: a->a) = 1-P and P(I: a->b) = 1-Q, while P(!R: a->b) = P and P(!I: a->a) = Q. An expression like R(v: 1->1) -> !I(v: 1->1) means that a bit whose initial value is 1 is correctly reflected, and then incorrectly inverted. We can abbreviate this to [1->1->1]. R must follow I and vice versa, so we will have a chain of events R->I->R->I-> etc.</t>

	<t>In order for a reflection or an inversion to occur, there must be a trigger. The spin edge is the trigger. But in the event of [1->1->1] the spin edge has disappeared! Once the bit spins back to the reflection, it will have the same value as when it started. In fact, regardless of the starting value, any R->I event that results in [1->1] or [0->0] leads to a loop.</t> 
	
	<t>We can define the following events:</t>
	
	<t><list>
	  <t>A: [1->1]. 
	  </t>
	  <t>B: [0->0]. 
	  </t>
	  <t>C: [0->1]. 
	  </t>
	  <t>D: [1->0]. 
	  </t>
        </list></t>
	
	<t>Event A can occur as a result of (!R, !I) for starting point v=0, or as a result of (R, !I) for starting point v=1 or v=0. Event B can occur as a result of (!R, !I) for starting point v=1, or as a result of (R, !I) for starting point v=1 or v=0. Event C occurs as a result of (!R, I) for starting point v=1, or (R, I) for starting point v=0. Event D occurs as a result of (!R, I) for starting point v=0 or (R, I) for starting point v=0. The starting point v can be taken as the final digit in each event, meaning that for the event following C, the starting point would be v=1, and for the event following D, the starting point would be v=0.</t>

<t>With this information, and the probabilities determined above, we can create a transition matrix in the Markovian sense.</t>
	
<figure title="RRM transition matrix, no reset and no edge-id bit" anchor="illus6"><artwork><![CDATA[

+----+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|    |     A     |     B     |     C     |     D     |
+----+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| A  |     1     |     0     |     0     |     0     |
+----+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+

<t>It should be quite clear from this matrix that events A and B act as sinks. Because ending in a sink removes all possibility of future measurements, we could hope to avoid this situation. The easiest way is setting Q=0, which would imply there is always a correct inversion. For any Q > 0, this process will eventually end up in a sink.</t>

  </section>

    <section anchor="example2" title="Analysis: Reset and no edge identifying bit ">
    
<t>The possible outcomes are as in <xref target="example1" />, and the problem to be resolved is that the spin edge eventually disappears with probability 1.</t>
	
<t>Introducing the probability R of a random re-set of the spin bit at every m:th bit transmission can "re-initiate" the edge by taking the entire system back into the situation described in <xref target="illus3" />. If we let A be the number of ticks between client and server, and B the number of ticks between server and client, the total amount of ticks in a round trip time is A+B=C. If R>1/2 and m >> C, a loop of bits set to v=1 after the second round-trip is perhaps broken after km steps, where k is an integer whose distribution is geometric (1-R). An observation point will pick up sequences of v=0 that can be used as a basis for measurement at time intervals km.</t>

<t>In the case of a one-way observations, such as X in <xref target="illus4" />, there may be full-length sequences of v=0 whose average will be as described above. In the case of a two-way observation, such as Y in <xref target="illus4" /> , after each reset there will be a probability P(1-Q) that a half-sequence of v=1 will be detected at the bottom Y, and probability 1/2 that a full sequence will be detected at the top Y.</t>

</section>
	
</section>

<section anchor="eachbit" title="RRM at each bit">

  <t>Let us say any bit transmitted from either the client or the server is "off" in relation to what it proposed in the Spin Bit model with some probability P. If P -> 0.5, the spinning bits will come across as a random 0s and 1s and it will be difficult to estimate any edge. However, if P is less than 0.5, the spin edge can be estimated for instance by computing an average number of 0s or 1s in the past m ticks. For all averages above some cut-off rate, a measurement counter could be incremented by one. Eventually one would end up with a series (k'0, ..., k'n) that roughly corresponds to (k0, ..., kn) above.</t>

  <section anchor="example3" title="Analysis: Estimating true values of a bit">
    
<t>The bit spins in the foreseen way. Every time a bit is transmitted, there is a probability P that it holds a different value than it should. In <xref target="illus4" /> , either measurements station X or both stations Y observe a passing bit, as well as bits passing before or after that bit (if any). After observing 2k+1 bits (b[-k], ..., b[0], ..., b[k]) the true value of bit b[0] is estimated, for instance based on whether the majority of b[i] were v=0 or v=1. The estimated value is then used to increment a sequence counter.</t>

<t>The estimator follows a binomial distribution (drawing with replacement), and the risk of misidentifying a bit is equal to the risk of having (k+1) v=1 bits in the 2k observations where b[0] "should" be attributed to v=0. This risk depends on P and k.</t>

<t>Setting k too large creates a risk of having estimator sequences that are longer than the round-trip time (RTT) to be measured. If P is reasonably small, estimation will still eventually be possible after a sufficient amount of measurements. One option is to keep P variable and determined by the client, introducing the possibility of choice in RTT measurements.</t>
  
</section>
  
</section>

</section>

<section anchor="conclusion" title="Conclusion">

  <t>The spin bit is associated with an IP address which creates linkability (see <xref target="RFC6973"/> and <xref target="RFC8280"/>). The privacy concern associated with a spin bit is, additionally, that latency measurements will enable inferrence of the location or distance of the device associated with that particular IP address.</t>

  <t>Randomized response mechanisms (RRM) would either cause the utility of the spin bit to disappear entirely (by rendering any measurement futile) or cause the primary privacy-reducing inferrence to remain a problem, as long as a sufficiently large amount sequential measurements were done. Each measurement would continue to be tied to fixed identifier, which necessarily implies privacy loss.</t>

  <t>For this reason, it is not clear that RRM would ultimately bring any particular privacy benefit beyond what is already guaranteed in the present proposal. A possible option is to allow a client to set a randomization value P in such a way that it could be close to 1/2, in the case where each bit is always RRM-protected. Then the client would have the option of avoiding latency measurements entirely.</t>
