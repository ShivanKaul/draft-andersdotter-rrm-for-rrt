    <abstract>

<t>This is a change. This draft summarizes the results of an inquiry into the potential of using randomized response mechanism (RRM) to preserve privacy in round-trip time (RTT) measurements in HTTP3. It concludes that RRM is not a feasible mechanism for privacy preservation for such measurements.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>At the IETF104 convening of the Privacy Enhancements and (PEA) Research Group, a presentation on Differential Privacy (<xref target="AA-CL"/>) gave rise to the idea of trying to apply Randomized Response methods to the QUIC Spin Bit described in <xref target="TRAMMEL"/> and <xref target="KUEHLEWIND"/>. The QUIC Spin Bit had generated controversy from a privacy perspective, both in the Working Group meetings and on e-mailing lists and been re-ignited through the publication of a subsequent Human Rights Consideration in <xref target="TENOEVER-MARTINI"/>. 
</t>

<t>Randomized response trials were originally created for binary environments: if a series of measurements has only two possible outcomes (0 or 1, yes or no, true or false, for instance), it is the idea that allowing individual respondents to answer "falsely" at a predictable rate will still preserve the ability to make inferences on the entire set of respondents. The Spin Bit, being a bit, is binary outcome variable. Each time it is measured, the idea is that it can either "truthfully" report its value as what it should be according to <xref target="TRAMMEL"/>, or it could, at some known rate or probability, report the opposite value.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="rrt" title="Randomized Response Mechanisms">

  <t>Randomized Response Mechanisms (RRM) rely on the ability to make sense of data with known errors and were originally developed to facilitate surveys on sensitive topics such as alcohol or drug abuse, or political affiliation. The design allows a survey taker to provide, with some known probability P, a "false" answer ("yes" instead of "no", for example) to a survey question. It is meant to encourage truthful answers even in surveys where participants may otherwise feel compelled to give false answers.</t>

  <t>RRMs are most easily illustrated for binary response problems. Let's take as an example "Did you go to the last IETF meeting?" The answer to this question is either yes or no. If 30% of all responses are known to be false, we have four categories of responses: true yes, true no, false yes and false no. From these numbers we can calculate the proportion of recurring visitors to the IETF.</t>

  <t>RRMs can also be applied to multiple choice questions. Estimation of true proportions becomes more difficult as the number of possible answers per question goes up. Further examples can be found in <xref target="DWORK"/> and <xref target="FOX"/>.</t>

<section anchor="asb" title="Application to Spin Bit">

<t>As described in <xref target="TRAMMEL"/>, the Spin Bit is a mechanism for measuring round-trip-times (RTT) in the QUIC protocol. Its operation is captured by the following five images:</t>

<t>Initially, during connection establishment, no packets with a spin bit are in flight, as shown in <xref target="illus0"/>.</t>

<figure title="Initial state, no spin bit between client and server" anchor="illus0"><artwork><![CDATA[
+--------+   -  -  -  -  -   +--------+
|        |     -------->     |        |
| Client |                   | Server |
|        |     <--------     |        |
+--------+   -  -  -  -  -   +--------+
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Either the server, the client, or both can begin sending packets with short
headers after connection establishment, as shown in <xref target="illus1"/>; here, no spin
edges are yet in transit.</t>

<figure title="Client and server begin sending packets with spin 0" anchor="illus1"><artwork><![CDATA[
+--------+   0  0  -  -  -   +--------+
|        |     -------->     |        |
| Client |                   | Server |
|        |     <--------     |        |
+--------+   -  -  0  0  0   +--------+
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Once the server’s first 0-marked packet arrives at the client, the client sets
its spin value to 1, and begins sending packets with the spin bit set, as
shown in <xref target="illus2"/>. The spin edge is now in transit toward the server.</t>

<figure title="The bit begins spinning" anchor="illus2"><artwork><![CDATA[
+--------+   1  0  0  0  0   +--------+
|        |     -------->     |        |
| Client |                   | Server |
|        |     <--------     |        |
+--------+   0  0  0  0  0   +--------+
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Five ticks later, this packet arrives at the server, which takes its spin
value from it and reflects that value back on the next packet it sends, as
shown in <xref target="illus3"/>. The spin edge is now in transit toward the client.</t>

<figure title="Server reflects the spin edge" anchor="illus3"><artwork><![CDATA[
+--------+   1  1  1  1  1   +--------+
|        |     -------->     |        |

|        |     <--------     |        |
+--------+   0  0  0  0  1   +--------+
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Five ticks later, the 1-marked packet arrives at the client, which inverts its
spin value and sends the inverted value on the next packet it sends, as shown
in <xref target="illus4"/>.</t>

<figure title="Client inverts the spin edge" anchor="illus4"><artwork><![CDATA[
      obs. points  X  Y

|        |     <--------     |        |

                      Y
]]></artwork></figure>

<t> In each iteration of <xref target="illus3" />-<xref target="illus4" /> the a sequence of 0s or 1s the length of which is k0 for iteration 0, k1 for iteration 1, and so forth, can be measured (by X or Y in the picture). The length of each sequence equals the amount of ticks required to pass from the client back to the client. After n iterations, an average can be taken of the measurements (k0, ..., kn). This average can be multiplied by the amount of time per tick (a quantity which is assumed to be known) to get a value for the round-trip time (RTT).</t>

<t>Applying randomized response mechanisms (RRMs) would boil down to perturbing the measurements (k0, ..., kn). Such perturbation could happen in different ways.</t>

<t>RRMs could be applied so that that each bit transmitted from the client and the server has a probability P of being the "wrong" value. It could also be applied so that the reflections/inversions described in <xref target="illus3" />-<xref target="illus4" /> do not occur with probability Q. The server or the client could be assumed to always behave as described in <xref target="illus3" />-<xref target="illus4" /> with no RRM. Different probabilities could be applied to the server and client, respectively, transmitting a "wrong" value or delaying a reflection.</t>

<section anchor="reflection" title="RRM at reflection/inversion">

  <t>The omission of a reflection or inversion would create difficulties. Namely, let's say the client omits the inversion in <xref target="illus4" />. Now there is no longer a spin edge so there is nothing to activate future reflections/inversions.</t>

  <t>A possible work-around is having an additional bit to indicate a spin edge, assigned by the server to the bit which is (not) reflected in <xref target="illus3" />, or by the client to the bit which is (not) inverted in <xref target="illus4" />. In this case there would not be a point in applying RRM since the placement of the spin edge would no longer be obfuscated. The omission of a reflection/inversion would be defeated by the presence of an alternate identifier.</t>

  <t>Another possible work-around is to do random re-sets of the spin bit, i.e., starting the process fresh from <xref target="illus1" />. Observers X and Y in <xref target="illus4" /> would then get a series of measurements (k0, ..., kn), some of which were far too large, but would, over time, be able to deduce RTT from the smaller measurements. The expected proportion of large and small measurements in the whole set of measurements could be determined from the probabilities that a reflection/inversion does not happen and the probability that the spin bit is re-initiated.</t>
  
<section anchor="example1" title="Sample calculation">
<t>The bit starts spinning with value v=0 at t=0. At the point of reflection, it does not reflect with probability P. At the point of inversion, it does not invert with probability Q.</t> 

	<t>That gives four possible outcomes after one "lap":</t>
	
	<t>1. With probability P(1-Q) the client will continue transmitting v=0 and there will no longer be a clear spin edge.</t>
	
	<t>2. With probability (1-P)Q the client will continue transmitting v=0 and there will no longer be a clear spin edge.</t>
	
	<t>3. With probability (1-P)(1-Q) the first rotation of the spin bit will be such a measurement as is foreseen by the specification.</t>
	
	<t>4. With probability PQ the the first and a half rotation of the spin bit will be such a measurement as is foreseen by the specification (taking the server as a base-line rather than the client).</t>
	
	<t>The only way of minimizing the risk of eliminating the spin edge is by setting P=Q=1/2, but this would imply that half of the time the spin bit is no longer able to serve its purpose.</t>
	
	<t>Introducing the probability R of a random re-set of the spin bit at every m:th bit transmission can remedy this problem.</t>
</section>
	
</section>

<section anchor="eachbit" title="RRM at each bit">

  <t>Let's say any bit transmitted from either the client or the server is "off" in relation to what it proposed in the Spin Bit model with some probability P. If P -> 0.5, the spinning bits will come across as a random 0s and 1s and it will be difficult to estimate any edge. However, if P is less than 0.5, the spin edge can be estimated for instance by computing an average number of 0s or 1s in the past m ticks. For all averages above some cut-off rate, a measurement counter could be incremented by one. Eventually one would end up with a series (k'0, ..., k'n) that roughly corresponds to (k0, ..., kn) above.</t>
  
</section>

</section>

<section anchor="conclusion" title="Conclusion">

  <t>The spin bit is associated with an IP address which creates linkability (see <xref target="RFC6973"/> and <xref target="RFC8280"/>). The privacy concern associated with a spin bit is, additionally, that latency measurements will enable inferrence of the location or distance of the device associated with that particular IP address.</t>

  <t>Randomized response mechanisms (RRM) would either cause the utility of the spin bit to disappear entirely (by rendering any measurement futile) or preserver the primary privacy-reducing inferrence, as long as a sufficiently large amount sequential measurements were done. Each measurement would continue to be tied to fixed identifier, which necessarily implies privacy loss.</t>

  <t>For this reason, it is not clear that RRM would ultimately bring any particular privacy benefit beyond what is already guaranteed in the present proposal.</t>
