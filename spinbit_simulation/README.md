# Spin Bit Simulation

You can use variables P and Q in the call to `run_simulation()` in `run_simulation.py` as referred to in the draft to customize the simulation run. You can also change `length_of_path` and `total_ticks`. 


Note that we are only simulating logical flow of spinbits without any consideration for packet loss etc. Also, we are only concerned with the spinbit part of the packet.
